How to turn something you want to say into an actual clip in rotation.

## Usage

```
echo "Your script here." | ./generate_and_upload.sh <voice_id> <dest_path.mp3>
```

Text comes in on stdin, not as an argument - avoids shell-quoting problems
with apostrophes and quotes in spoken text. `voice_id` is the ElevenLabs
voice ID from `identity.md`. `dest_path` is where the file lands in the
station's media library (see below for how to pick it).

The script generates the audio via ElevenLabs, uploads it to AzuraCast, and
prints the resulting media object (including its media ID) on success.

## Where uploads go - always a subfolder, never the top level

`dest_path` is a real path in the station's media library, not just a
filename. The library is organized into folders on purpose - don't upload
flat at the root even though the API will happily let you.

Put spoken clips under `interstitials/`, e.g.
`interstitials/back-announce-2026-08-22.mp3`. Use subfolders under that if a
category grows large enough to want one (e.g. `interstitials/intros/`,
`interstitials/trivia/`) rather than dumping everything in one flat folder
once there's enough of it to be hard to scan.

The one existing exception is `test/`, used for one-off pipeline tests, not
real on-air content. New real clips go under `interstitials/`, not `test/`.

## What this doesn't do yet

Generating and uploading a file doesn't put it into rotation on its own -
that's a separate step in AzuraCast (adding it to a playlist, setting up the
playlist-group weighting CLAUDE.md describes). Not built yet; write up how
you do it here once it exists.
